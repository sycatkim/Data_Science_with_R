# I have done a lot of prep to make two files dw and citeGraph.
#   I'm not sharing my code because I wrote it a long time ago 
#   and it is not taking advantage of any of the nice packages for "text processing" 
#   that are now available:
library(tm)
# also:
# library(tidytext) # http://tidytextmining.com

stopwords()  # this is from tm
mean(colnames(dw) %in% stopwords())

# words often have several "forms" and it is often useful to "preprocesses" the text.
# plural, upper/lower case, different forms (e.g "-ed"... use "stems")
# hard way (by hand):
x = colnames(dw)[4]
plural = max(gregexpr("s",x)[[1]]) == nchar(x)
# easy way: use a proper text processing package!

#  why are we talking about bag-of-words and graphs in the same day?
#    they are a fundamentally similar in many ways.
#    graphs can be stored as sparse matrices:
Acite = get.adjacency(citeGraph)
str(Acite)
isSymmetric(Acite)
# for what comes next, symmetric graphs are "nicer"...

#   no edges between documents. 
#   no edges between words.
#   only edges from documents to words. 
#   such graphs are *bipartite graphs*.

#  these types of matrices often have "long tailed degree distributions"
hist(rowSums(dw))
hist(colSums(dw))
hist(colSums(Acite))
# this makes things tricky to deal with!  
#   "normalization" (of some sort) is often a key processing step to deal with this!

# also, these big matrices often reveal "clusters"
#   in the WikiCountyGraph, these aligned with states.
# what could they align with here?
